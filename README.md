# Life++

This is an optimized implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

I was challenged during my internship to write a version of [barnex/life](https://github.com/barnex/life) using C++
instead of Go. One year later, I eventually took a stab at it. Here is the result, I've yet to compare the performance,
but I am hopeful that mine will be faster.
